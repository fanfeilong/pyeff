def get_python_file_func_indent_spaces(filepath, func):
    """
    Retrieve the indentation spaces used before the function definition in a Python file.
    
    This function opens a Python file, searches for the given function definition,
    and then determines the number of spaces or tabs used for indentation at the start of the line
    following the function definition. It assumes that the function definition is properly formatted
    and that the indented line following the function definition represents code within that function.
    
    Parameters:
    - filepath (str): The path to the Python file.
    - func (str): The name of the function to find the indentation for.

    Returns:
    - str: A string representing the indentation, consisting of spaces and/or tabs.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If no indented lines are found following a line starting with the function name.
